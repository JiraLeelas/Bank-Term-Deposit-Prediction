# Portuguese Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
## Problem Statement
A bank term deposit is a fixed-term investment that offer higher interest rates than standard savings accounts. In exchanged for higher interest rates, customers agree not to withdraw their deposit for a specific period (Chen, 2024). This arrangement appeals to investors seeking low-risked investments options while providing banks with stable sources of cash for lending at higher interest rate. This study aims to utilize a marketing dataset to create a predictive model to predict wheter a client would subscribed to term deposit, revealing a valuable insight to the bank marketing function.

## Bank Marketing Dataset
The dataset used in this repository is the [Bank Marketing Full Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) 
available publicly on UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information from an anonymous Portuguese banking direct phone call marketing campaign to promote bank term deposit subscriptions (Moro et al., 2014).
